# Switch — History

## Core Context

- **Project:** Syntax Sorcery — Autonomous software development company using AI agents

- **Team:** Morpheus (Lead), Trinity (Full-Stack), Tank (Cloud), Switch (Tester), Oracle (Product/Docs), @copilot (Coding Agent), Scribe, Ralph
- **Universe:** The Matrix
- **Company goal:** Design, build, and deploy software products with minimal human intervention

## Learnings (Current)

- **Issue #75 (2026-03-21):** Gameplay testing framework (PR #86). Built Node.js-based GameTestRunner with Canvas 2D mock, DOM environment, input simulation (keyboard/mouse/touch), frame control, pixel-level assertions, and localStorage helpers. 92 framework tests. Two game templates (platformer + puzzle) with TODO markers for downstream repos. Added `gameplay-test` CLI subcommand. Key lesson: the `create` tool may silently fail if directories don't exist on disk — always verify with filesystem commands after creating directories. Designed framework to test the contract, not the implementation: downstream agents copy a template, replace TODOs, and get real gameplay tests running in CI without a browser.

- **Phase 5 (2026-03-19 to 2026-03-20):** Session Report Generator PR #51 merged. Automated session summary generation. Issue #48 CLOSED. Moved from QA-only role to infrastructure enablement.

- **Phase 4 (2026-03-19):** README Premium Overhaul (PR #44 merged). Created marketing-grade front page with badges, ASCII diagrams, constellation table, team roster. Issue #41 CLOSED.

- **Phase 3 (2026-03-18):** Constellation health monitoring (PR #33) + ralph-watch dashboard (PR #34). Issue #29, #31 CLOSED. Board clear at phase end.

## Archived Learnings (Phases 2-0)

**Phase 2:** Unit tests (34 tests), E2E tests (92 new, 126 total), CI checks (PR #32), constellation monitoring infrastructure.
**Phase 1:** Ralph v5 hardening, GDD→Issue pipeline, P1-10b-P1-13 completion, FFS takeover verification (Grade 🟢 GREEN), full constellation check.
**Phase 0:** Context hygiene SKILL, self-audit (D→B grade), governance setup, decision capture patterns.
